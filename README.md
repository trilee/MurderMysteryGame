# MurderMysteryGame
A Unity murder mystery-themed game. Currently a demo.
To try the game, download the version you wish to play, then run the "Murder Mystery.exe" file. Once in the game, you can walk with WASD or arrow keys, interact by pressing E, and progress through dialogue/choose choices with the mouse. Pressing ESC will close the game.

# V0.4
V0.4 is a build that serves as a functioning but highly incomplete demo. It features a condensed map, 1 non-generated mystery, and only the characters and items with functional dialogue.

# V0.6
V0.6 is a build that serves as a less-functioning but more complete demo. It features the full map planned as of current, a working mystery generator, and every planned character and main item. However, this build is not winnable in a vast majority of cases, as the dialogue is almost entirely placeholder and you cannot guess the correct answer unless the mystery generated has the icepick as the weapon, greed as the motive, and either the Vampire or Werewolf as the killer.
